## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 2, Part 1:

  I enjoyed this lab as it laid the foundation for all the labs that followed. Learning how to declare string variables, initialize values, prompt the computer user, and store the userâ€™s input came    in handy, as this lab made me feel confident when applying it to all the future labs. Seeing the computer prompt the user and their input being applied to the variable was exciting at the            beginning of the course.

* Lab 4, Part 1:

  I enjoyed this lab as it helped me understand how to convert variables and initialize them to their appropriate functions, in this case, measurements. Learning how to properly write measurement      conversions to provide the user with the proper return measurement was fun. Overall, it was exciting writing a program that deals with real-life situations such as measurements, which we often use   in baking or cooking.

* Lab 10, Part 1:

  I enjoyed this lab as it helped me to better understand string vectors. In this lab, we used loops to search through the vector, using the += operator to get the names of the counties and add them   to the string of counties. Through the use of std::stoi(), we were able to take the name of the county and convert its population into an integer. This was fun as it gives us a glimpse of real       life and how the data of the census is calculated to get the population of every county.
